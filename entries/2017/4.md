Week 4 (23 Jan 2017)

# go-ethereum Core

* Finalised 64 bit gas instructions, unmetered `eth_calls` [go-ethereum/#3514](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3514)
* Refactored core/state package [go-ethereum/#3618](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3618)
* Preliminary investigations into state pruning / GC

# Geth and go-ethereum library

* Account management refactors to support different backends [go-ethereum/#3604](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3604)
* Ledger USB protocol implementation and integration
https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3592
* Preparing EIP and implementation for `eth_injectCall` [go-ethereum/#3612](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3612)

# cpp-ethereum Core

* First round of EVM 1.5: Subroutines and static jumps [EIPs/#187](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/187)
* New version of State Journal
* Started work on fast sync.

# EIPS

* EVM 1.5 EIP [EIPs/184](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/184)

# ENS

* More work on JS libraries and DApp
* Fixing build issues in the DApp relating to ES6
* DApp almost ready to go!

# Testing

* Rough implementation of Hive-based cross-client testing using the shared ethereum tests. 

# Solidity

## Features:

* Compiler interface: Contracts and libraries can / have to be referenced with a ``file:`` prefix to  make them unique.
* Compiler interface: Report source location of "stack too deep" errors.
* Compiler interface: Started working on compiling snippets for `eth_injectCall`  [#EIPs/144](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/144)
* AST: Use deterministic node IDs.
* Type system: Introduce type identifier strings.
* Type checker: Warn about invalid checksum for addresses and deduce type from valid ones.
* Metadata: Do not include platform in the version number.
* Metadata: Add option to store sources as literal content.
* Code generator: Extract array utils into low-level functions.

## Bugfixes:

* Code generator: Allow recursive structs.
* Inline assembly: Disallow variables named like opcodes.
* Type checker: Allow multiple events of the same name (but with different arities or argument types)
* Remappings: Prefer longer context over longer prefix.
* Type checker, code generator: enable access to events of base contracts' names.
* Imports: ``import ".dir/a"`` is not a relative path.  Relative paths begin with directory ``.`` or ``..``.
 
# Remix

* TreeView for state/local variables
* Allow stepping over source location instead of bytescode
* Bug fixes
* Renamed browser-solidity to remix (setup remix.ethereum.org)

# Mist

* Production Code-signing for macOS and direct uploading using TravisCI
* Added 'mist.solidity.version' to Mist-API
* Improved  account importer to support web3 keyfiles (geth, eth, parity and  myethereumwallet); npm-module to sanatize web3 keyfiles (https://github.com/luclu/ethereum-keyfile-recognizer)
* Fixed offline startup issue
* Adjustments to confirmation popup-window

# web3.js

* Modularisation of web3.js in merged into the 1.0 branch: [web3/#541](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/pull/541)
* All test run again on the modularized web3.js
* All functions are promisified and the new contract object is ready!
* Next steps will Documentation [update](http://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/)

# Whisper

* Working on the stand-alone Whisper node

# Formal Verification:

* Hoare logic [progress 30%](https://github.com/pirapira/eth-isabelle/milestone/4)

# swarm 

* the raw protocol now supports paths, i.e. you can retrieve embedded manifests [go-ethereum/#3615](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3615)
* swarm subcommands now allow manifest manipulation (add, remove) [go-ethereum/#3572](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3572)
* work started on FUSE mounting a swarm manifest as file system in user space [go-ethereum/3539](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3539)
* the testnet is moved to its separate cluster bringing more stability 
* there is a new on-demand internal testnet to do simulations of complex network behaviour, remote node controller is in the making https://github.com/ethersphere/go-ethereum/tree/kubernetes
* the network testing and simulation framework visualisation demo has seen some TLC using D3 https://github.com/fablife/simple-p2p-d3
* new swarm dapp, displaying markdown content 

# ewasm/ethereumjs

* updated ewasm-kernel to use message passing for all state access
* update evm2ewasm to use the new api
