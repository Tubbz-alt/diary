# Solidity:
- first proof-of-concept for compiling snippets
- functions for assembly

# Hive:
- Add support for subresult reporting in network simulations: https://github.com/karalabe/hive/commit/2a6c1aa7a0a43ccdba1342f4ae3641f370b499e2
- Aggregates all results for different test types into a single JSON report: https://github.com/karalabe/hive/compare/9625044...dba20b6

# Tests
- General State Tests converted to Blockchain tests to be able to run on hive

#Security/Testing
- Cross-client consensus test framework using Hive. Currently passing all 96 (old) tests for Geth and Parity https://github.com/holiman/hive/tree/hive_blocktests

# Mist
- Version 0.8.9 released https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases/tag/v0.8.9
- Update to geth 1.5.8
- More test cases covered
- Updated all dependent node-modules
- Improvements to travis and gulp build system
- Persisting Mist window size and position https://github.com/ethereum/mist/pull/1641/files
- Started to make v

# Formal verification:
- thanks @seed for a neat cleanup https://github.com/pirapira/eth-isabelle/pull/318/files
- setting up separation predicate for memory ranges https://github.com/pirapira/eth-isabelle/pull/319/files

# Whisper
Release of wnode (whisper stand-alone node)

# Swarm
* proximity order binary tree. new data structure underlying kademlia and probably chunk memory cache
* swarm testnet migrated. backed by new dedicated cluster (the cluster can no longer interfere with ethereum core and consensus monitoring) 
* deployed k8s using acs-engine in new datacenter 
* markdown editor dapp is getting an editor
