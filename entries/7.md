# Dev diary: entry 2

The Ethereum Developer Logs - Stardate 5217.3

The C++ team welcomes 2 additional team members

* [@gcolvin](https://github.com/gcolvin)
* [@bobsummerwill](https://github.com/bobsummerwill)

Both will work part time on eth, make it slimmer, easier to build and maintain and hopefully bring is to a fast-syncing light client.

## General

* Homestead website
* Homestead [documentation](https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.org/en/latest) initiative ([source](https://github.com/ethereum/homestead-guide/))

## C++

We released version 1.0.0 of Mix and version 1.1.2 of ++eth and shortly after version 1.1.3.
https://github.com/ethereum/mix/releases/tag/v1.0.0
https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/releases/tag/v1.1.3

### Solidity

* Index access for bytesN types: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/382
* Ongoing work to implement fixed point types (needs a refactoring of the token class)

### Mix

* Some file system fixes on Windows (still not perfect)
* Ongoing bug fixes

### ++Eth

* Crash fixes concerning the hashrate, should make the console work again
* EIP-8 (new connection handshake protocol)

## Go

The Go team has been fixing quite a few (expected) regressions from the previous
[RPC (#2140)](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/2140) PR which migrated
the code base away from the old to the new RPC implementation.

The following tasks are specific to the `develop` branch of
[go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum).
